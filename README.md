In this work I trained several models to address two different tasks:
1. Trigger word detection
A simple CNN model was trained to detect the word "on" (the trigger word)
2. Number and gender identification
Trained a simple CNN model and a ResNet-34 based model to identify the gender and number in an audio.

To see a demo of the system, check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XXXRFbT3Uc
